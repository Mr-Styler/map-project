                <p>Mind Accelerator Program also known as MAP is a program designed to help people, young adults especially, realize the inherent power they possess and harness this power. The organizers of this program believe that the first step in Human Empowerment is to teach them “How to think”, give necessary information and allow them to come to self-realization about what they possess and how to use it to become who they were designed to be even before time began.</p>
                <p>This program exposes fundamental and foundational information already known to man but hidden from the eyes of many. The beautiful thing about these information is that they are infinitely divisible. If you have them, that can help you to be more effective in your life and if it is shared, everyone is enriched.</p>
                <p>The program amongst other programs deliberately aims to support people to become the best version of themselves.</p>
